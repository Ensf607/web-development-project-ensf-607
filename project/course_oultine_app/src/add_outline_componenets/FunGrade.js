            <p>The final grade in this course will be based on the following components:</p>
            <p>
                <h5 className="subtitle"> Notes: </h5>
                <li> a) You must either achieve at least 50% on the final exam or achieve at least 50% on the weighted average of the midterm and final exam. You must also achieve an average of at least 50% on the lab section of the course. If you do not satisfy these caveats, you will not receive a passing grade. </li>

                <li> b) Circumstances beyond oneâ€™s control (e.g. sickness, etc.), leading to missing lab session and/or delays in assignment submissions should be discussed with the course instructor as soon as possible. Proper documentation must be provided.</li>

                <li> c) Conversion from a score out of 100 to a letter grade will be done using the conversion chart shown below. This grading scale can only be changed during the term if the grades will not be lowered.</li>
